Our system focuses on aiding a person who met an accident by informing nearby hospital and police station.Our project uses gps to fetch the location of the injured person and send it our server, Our server finds out the nearest hospital and police station with the help of the web app developed by our team to assist in the process.
We also developed a mobile app that stores 5 Emergegency contacts who are informed by sms services the location where the accident occured so that they can reach the location soon.
We further plan on adding alert service for nearby traffic police and nearby car to inform them about the accident on that ,so that they can clear the route for the ambulance .
If this project is implemented in real world, we are planning to use analytics to record the rate of accidents and speed of the cars travelling on that route and determine a speed limit to keep the travellers safe.Our system will warn the driver about the speed and risk of driving above that speed.
